# football-player-card

This is a card filter component build on Node-v10.19.0, which utilized Gulp for tasks, Webpack for script bundling 
and trinspiling, Jest and Puppeteer for testing. 

Due to time contraints some of the components have not been tasted, the select element hasn't been styled appropriately,
a json file has been used for a db and no `get/:id` route has been implemented but browser storage has been used instead.

To run the app, clone the repo run `yarn install` and `gulp` to serve the app, `gulp test` to test.
